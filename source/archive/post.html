				God of War is GOLD, baby!!! Going gold is an important milestone for a game. In fact, it is one of the ‘big two’ really. You have getting ‘greenlit’, which kicks off the real development of your title, and ‘going gold’ as the two most important milestones in a games development cycle.
			</p>
			<p>
				The latter is the right of passage that lets the team, and more importantly the world, know that the game’s development is pretty much complete. All that remains is the manufacturing and shipping part of the process.

				Going gold means so much more to me with this game.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been a long and exhausting journey filled with laughs, arguments, and a healthy dose of fear – with a side of doubt.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the scariest, most wonderful thing I have ever done and I can honestly say it would never have been possible without the full-throated support of Sony and the tireless work of the incredible team at Santa Monica Studio. We have been through a lot together and I would not change a thing. You are the best damn team a director could ever hope for and I am thankful beyond words for every ounce of passion and pride you put into this game.
